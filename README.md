# Betme.gg
A betting application allowing users to watch, see upcoming, and bet against their friends on esport matches. Betme.gg sources upcoming match data and results from Pandascore. Twitch integration allows users to watch the games right then and there and also offers chatting with other viewers. Active and historical bet information is stored and displayed for users on various pages. We also use a proprietary currency called GG.Coins which users can use to make bets and also earn to brag to their friends!
